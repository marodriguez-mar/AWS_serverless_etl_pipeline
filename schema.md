## üîë Notes
- The combination of `order_id` and `order_date` identifies a unique order.  
- Since each row corresponds to a product within the order:  
  - Multiple rows can share the same `order_id` and `order_date`.  
  - `total_amount` is repeated across these rows to indicate the overall order value.  
- The schema allows for both **customer-level analysis** (e.g., total spend by customer) and **product-level analysis** (e.g., most popular product categories).
